We will look at a .NET Core 8 / Angular 17 application and discuss security vulnerabilities, learn how attackers think about exploitation and how you can think securely about your applications. <br><br> Attendees who want to work along with me during the workshop will need to get the application running on their laptops before the session. Instructions available in the GitHub repository for the test application.",
